This is a bracket implementation using a binary tree. 
I'm still having trouble implementing the getViableParticipants method in the BracketImpl file. 
The getViableParticipants method is not passing test cases, it is supposed to identify a viable participant, which is a participant that can still move up in the bracket.
I'm absolutely lost on how to implement getViableParticipants.
